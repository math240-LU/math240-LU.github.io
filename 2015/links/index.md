### Links to most frequently used resources for this course:

* [Moodle](https://moodle.lawrence.edu): To check your grades
* [Piazza](https://piazza.com/lawrence/fall2015/math240/home): Go to the Q & A tab to post and answer questions related to course materials.
	- You may want to make use of LaTeX equations when you post questions. Below are some links to help you write such equations:
		- [Short Math Guide for LaTeX](ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf)
		- [How to LaTeX](http://www.sosmath.com/CBB/docs/howtolatex.pdf) (note that you should use $.....$ as equation delimiters, not [tex]....[\tex])
* [Videos](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube): Joe Blitzstein (one of the textbook's authors) recorded his probability lectures in 2011. We may not cover material in exactly the same order, but these videos may be helpful refreshers.
* [Solutions](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/stat110/files/selected_solutions_blitzstein_hwang_probability_2.pdf): There are approximately 250 strategic practice problems, with detailed solutions, marked with an "s" in the textbook.
* [Probability Distribution App](https://ismay.shinyapps.io/ProbApp): An interactive app displaying commonly used discrete and continuous probability distributions. You can also check your work using the probability calculator functionality.


### Links for transition to Econ 380:
* [Open Learning Initiative at Carnegie Mellon](http://oli.cmu.edu/courses/free-open/statistics-course-details/): This online set of modules is designed to be equivalent to an elementary statistics class. I recommend exploring units 1, 2 and 4 to prepare for Econ 380.
* [Khan Academy -- Inferential Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/statistics-inferential): Working through the material through hypothesis testing with one sample will help you bridge the gap. This material lacks coverage of confidene intervals, so the Carnegie Mellon option recommended, but these videos can supplement that material.
