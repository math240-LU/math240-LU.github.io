	- You may want to make use of LaTeX equations when you post questions. Below are some links to help you write such equations:
		- [Short Math Guide for LaTeX](ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf)
		- [How to LaTeX](http://www.sosmath.com/CBB/docs/howtolatex.pdf) (note that you should use $.....$ as equation delimiters, not [tex]....[\tex])
* [Videos](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube): Joe Blitzstein (one of the textbook's authors) recorded his probability lectures in 2011. We may not cover material in exactly the same order, but these videos may be helpful refreshers.
* [Solutions](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/stat110/files/selected_solutions_blitzstein_hwang_probability_2.pdf): There are approximately 250 strategic practice problems, with detailed solutions, marked with an "s" in the textbook.
* [Probability Distribution App](https://ismay.shinyapps.io/ProbApp): An interactive app displaying commonly used discrete and continuous probability distributions. You can also check your work using the probability calculator functionality.
