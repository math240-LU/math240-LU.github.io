<p>This course provides a comprehensive introduction to probability, as a language and set of tools for understanding statistics, science, risk, and randomness. Both the mathematical results of the subject and applications to solving problems will be studied, with examples ranging from gambling to genetics. It will cover</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basics: sample spaces and events, conditional probability, and Bayesâ€™ Theorem</li>
  <li>Univariate distributions: mass/density functions, expectation and variance, Normal, t, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Poisson, Beta, and Gamma distributions</li>
  <li>Multivariate distributions: joint and conditional distributions, independence, transformations, and the Multivariate Normal distribution</li>
  <li>Limit laws: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>


<p>The course includes: class meetings, office hours, and review
sessions. </p>

<p><strong>Class meetings</strong>: The course includes three 70-minute class meetings per week, and will be a mixture of lecture, student presentations, and group problem solving sessions. </p>

<p><strong>Office Hours</strong>: Attending office hours is another excellent way to succeed in this course. All office hours will be held in 410 Briggs Hall</p>

<!-- <p>Homework will be distributed each week on paper (typically at lecture on
Friday) and posted online.  You need to complete them in the spaces given on
the page where they appear, <strong>not</strong> electronically or on a separate piece of
paper.  (Having a single format helps us grade them and forces you to write
concisely.)  If you print your own copy, please print it double-sided.</p>

<p>Homework assignments are due in your lab section the week after they are handed out.  (For example, the homework handed out on Friday, 8/28 is due in lab on Wednesday 9/2 or, for those in the Thursday lab, Thursday 9/3.)</p>
 -->

<h2 id="computing-resources">Computing Resources</h2>


<!-- <p>All computing assignments in this course will be completed on
<a href="http://ds8.berkeley.edu">ds8.berkeley.edu</a>. You can complete all computing
labs and projects using any computer (or device) that has a web browser.</p>

<p>The lab room for the course is 105 Cory. If you would like to use a lab
computer to work on an assignment, all students will have 24 hour access
to this room whenever there is not another course using it. By enrolling in
the course, you will have card-key access to this room using your Cal ID card.</p> -->
